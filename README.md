# recursion
Project: Recursion - Ruby Course

Project Goal

Learn to build recursive methods by writing them for Fibonacci and Merge Sort 

- Fibonacci: "Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence, then write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively"
- Merge Sort: Build a method #merge_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology

How to Use the Project

- Run code in IRB
- Run file from the command line:  $ ruby recursion.rb
